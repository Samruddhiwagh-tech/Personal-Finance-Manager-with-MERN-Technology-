🎯 Future Enhancements
Since your current project focuses only on the frontend, here’s a more detailed breakdown of what you can add in the future:
 Add backend functionality
Integrate user authentication
Improve UI with animations and dark mode
🔹 Current Status: Right now, your app only has a frontend, meaning all the data (expenses, user profiles, etc.) is lost when you refresh the page.

🔹 Future Enhancement: You can integrate a backend to store and retrieve data permanently using:

    Node.js & Express.js (for backend API)
    MongoDB / MySQL (for database storage)
    🔹 Example Backend Features:
✅ Store user expenses in a database
✅ Fetch expense history when the user logs in
✅ Secure the data with authentication
🔹 Current Status: Right now, there is no authentication. Anyone can access the app.

🔹 Future Enhancement: You can allow users to log in and manage their own data instead of showing the same data to everyone.
✅ Forgot Password option (for password reset)
✅ Secure sessions (so users don’t get logged out immediately)
